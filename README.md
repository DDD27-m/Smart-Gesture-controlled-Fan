# Smart Gesture-Controlled Fan using Arduino Uno

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a **gesture-controlled fan** built with an Arduino Uno and an ultrasonic sensor.
By detecting the distance of a hand, the system adjusts the fan speed across three levels (Low, Medium, High) or turns it off completely. This ensures **touch-free operation**, making it hygienic and efficient for smart home applications.

## 🔧 Components Used

* Arduino Uno
* Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
* DC Fan + Motor Driver (L293D / transistor + diode)
* Breadboard & Jumper Wires
* USB Cable & Power Supply

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of a hand placed in front of it.
2. Arduino processes the distance values.
3. Depending on the detected distance, it generates a **PWM signal** to control the fan speed.

   * **2–10 cm → Low Speed**
   * **10–20 cm → Medium Speed**
   * **20–30 cm → High Speed**
   * **>30 cm → Fan OFF**
4. Output is displayed via the Serial Monitor.
